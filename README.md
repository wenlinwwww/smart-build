In this project, we developed 'SmartED', a web-based learning management system designed to enhance the learning and teaching experience for students and teachers. The project involved:  

- Agile Development: Our team adopted agile methodologies to respond flexibly to project changes.
- Initial Design and Iteration: Starting with a blackboard concept, we redesigned the project based on tutor feedback and user research.
- Technology Stack:
  - Front-End: We used Bootstrap for front-end development.
  - Back-End: The back-end was developed using CodeIgniter and PHPMyAdmin.
  - Cloud Service: Initially planned for UQ zone, we shifted to Google Cloud Platform for better stability.
- Containerization: Docker Swarm was used for consistent and secure development.
- User Interface and Experience: We redesigned the UI to simplify operations, switching to database and SQL analysis instead of machine learning. We also conducted a usability study for feedback.
- Features: The system includes student and teacher interfaces, offering functionalities like timetables, assignments, analytics, and a discussion platform.
- Outcome: The final version of SmartED was positively received, proving to be usable and effective in delivering an educational experience.
